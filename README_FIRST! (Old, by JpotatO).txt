#---Help:

1. You need to input your UserID first, you can do so by opening the "Variables.cfg" file
using the windows notepad, and change the value after "var_DF_UserID=", refresh the skin
after saving the file.

2. If you want to see the addons, right click on the skin, over "0_Persos" with your mouse
and in "Dead Frontier_HUD Addon" you'll see a list of sub-items below "!Backups", hover an
item and click on the *.ini in it, this popup is not user-friendly and a better system will
be created later for this matter.

3. If you have any other problem contact the Author using the "Best Contact" entry first.

4. for further help open the file "DF_HUD_Addon_CharacterStatus.ini" there's more help at
the top, and the changes, credits & ToDo list at the bottom.

#---Known Bugs:

1. The skin *data is sometime not updated in real time*, it comes from the RAW data and not
from rainmeter or the skin itself, you'll experience this when playing in the inner city,
open the inventory popup to refresh the data instantly.

2. If you refresh the skin or Rainmeter, or restart it, you'll lose all unsaved data (like OA timers)

3. There's a reading bug sometimes, it's an issue with rainmeter DLL read, just restart
Rainmeter and all will be good, contact the author if the problem persist.

------
*data is sometime not updated in real time*: Don't concern: Inventory slots, Cash, Character
name, Character rank, Character profession/class and some others.
